                <h3><strong>Kylie's Scenario 1: <br/><br/>Needing flexibility & Communication</strong></h3>
            </div>

            <div id="interviewNotes" class="col-8">
                <p> Kylie is a small business owner for collegiate clothing. She has received some interest from customers in starting up a fantasy football league. Kylie looked into FantasyMax as a route
                    for fantasy college football. When setting up her league, she needs to have a chat option available to her participants.
                    Because Kylie doesn't know for sure how many teams will be in the league, she needs flexibility with the size of the league.
                </p> 

                <br>
                <p> As Kylie signs in to FantasyMax as the commissioner of her league, she configures the league's chat with reaction options and storage settings.
                    The chat settings are accessible to each user with the inclusion of notification alerts, group environments, and separate individual messaging.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    While logged in to FantasyMax, Kylie reviewed the size of her league. The current setting has the league set
                    at a minimum of eight teams. For this season, she wants to adjust the minimum team size by 50% to ensure a 
                    smaller group will still be able to get involved.
                </p>
