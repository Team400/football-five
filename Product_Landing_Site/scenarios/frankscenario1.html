                <h3><strong>Frank's Scenario 1: <br/><br/>Making multi-team trades</strong></h3>
            </div>

            <div id="interviewNotes" class="col-8">
                <p>Frank is an avid college sports fan living in Naples, Florida. Frank is currently in a college fantasy football league through FantasyMax, and his team is lacking depth. 
                He wants to trade for multiple players to prepare for a playoff run.</p> 

                <br><br>
                <p>Frank signs into his fantasy team on FantasyMax's application. He immediately sees his roster of players, along with their individual 
                stats for the season. Due to injuries, his team is short-handed. He navigates to the Trade Portal where he can examine every team's roster compared to his own. 
                He homes in on three players that he would like to trade for - two are on Tony's team, the other one is on Wanda's team.</p> 

                <br><br>

                <p>In the Trade Portal, he selects both Tony and Wanda's teams to trade with. He then selects every player he wants to be involved in the trade 
                and denotes the destination of each player. After doing this, Frank submits the offer, and waits for the 
                trade to be approved by both Tony and Wanda. If both of them do not approve, the trade fails.</p>
