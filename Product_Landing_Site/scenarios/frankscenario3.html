                <h3><strong>Frank's Scenario 3: <br/><br/>Changing league matchup type</strong></h3>
            </div>

            <div id="interviewNotes" class="col-8">
                <p>Frank is a FantasyMax league commissioner living in Naples, FL. He was recently approached by some of the other teams in the league asking if they could switch 
                    up their league type. Every year they have played, they have played head-to-head leagues where teams would compete against each other. This year they want to try something new. </p> 

                <br><br>
        
                    <p>Frank, being the commissioner of their league, has access to the league settings in the FantasyMax application. He signs in, and since it is before the season, 
                    the application welcomes him back and suggests scheduling a time for their draft this year. He instead navigates to the league settings. He sees a variety of options all 
                    with descriptors. Head-to-Head is currently selected. </p> 

                <br><br>

                <p>He browses through the other options, including Total Points and League-to-League. He chooses League-to-League. This will provide his league's team owners a new challenge 
                    of working together to create the best league that scores the most points. Their league will then compete against other leagues throughout the season.</p>
