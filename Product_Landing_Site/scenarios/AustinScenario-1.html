                As the fantasy season approaches Austin is invited to multiple fantasy leagues in different friend groups. His co-workers all get together and chip in 20 bucks each to start the league. This league typically has people who are less interested in fantasy football itself, but theyâ€™re more interested in the fun competition. His friends get together and pay 100 bucks each to start another league. He also tries to join more serious leagues that you manage your team by buying certain caliber players during the draft.  
                <br/><br/>
                Austin has a profile on FantasyMax that he uses each year that stores all his account information from the previous year so signing up for FantasyMax is not an issue. Most of the time these leagues are spread out across various platforms. As Austin gets more involved with work, he wants a fantasy application that can handle all of his teams from various leagues in one location. 

                <br/><br/>

                Austin then must use an outside application to collect the money from friends. Sometime his friends pay only on Venmo, some use PayPal, and others only use Apple pay. He sends all the participants in the  league requests for payment on their preferred paying platform. Of course, some pay right away, but most participants must be reminded via text messages or email that the entry fees have yet to be paid. All the entry fees must be paid before the fantasy season starts or the player will not be able to participate in the fantasy season. 

                <br/><br/>

                Once everyone has paid for the season  Austin uses FantasyMax to enroll each participant in the league.
