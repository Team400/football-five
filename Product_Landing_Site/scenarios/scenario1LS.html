                    <h3><strong>Scenario: <br/><br/>Customizable dashboard</strong></h3>
                </div>

                <div id="interviewNotes" class="col-8">
                    <p>Karen is a high-school English teacher who has interest in a college fantasy football app around which her group of friends could enjoy friendly competition among themselves. For Karen, an important feature of the app would be a customizable dashboard. 

                        <br/><br/>Karen has only a casual interest in sports and in particular she is offended by the crass commercialism and exorbitant player salaries at the professional level. She does, however, support college sports as an important component of the college experience and a source of revenues to support academic institutions in their mission to provide advanced education. 
                        
                        <br/><br/>Karen is excited about the prospects of competition among her group of friends as a social activitiy. She and her friends are comfortable with the spectrum of digital technology, including smartphones and apps, social media, text and email. None of them are ardent sports fans but Karen is intrigued by the idea that managing a fantasy football team, either as individuals or couples, could become a major focus of the group's activities. She envisions weekly get-togethers, with or without dinners, to watch key games and tally the week's results. On informal polling she found a high level of enthusiasm among her friends. "Count me in" was the unanimous response.
                        
                        <br/><br/>Karen feels that this scenario would work best if the app had a dashboard displaying current performance statistics and rankings for the group's fantasy teams. This would require that the dashboard be customizable at the user level, but that is certainly possible using modern database technology and Javascript.
