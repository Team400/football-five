                <h3><strong>Frank's Scenario 2: <br/><br/>Auto-drafting a fantasy team</strong></h3>
            </div>

            <div id="interviewNotes" class="col-8">
                <p>Frank is a passionate college football fan, and he also works as a Quality Assurance Engineer in Naples, FL. His FantasyMax draft is scheduled for a Friday night at 6:30PM, 
                    but he has to work overtime. Frank wants to be sure his team will be drafted automatically since he will not be present during the draft.</p> 

                <br><br>
                <p>Frank navigates to the FantasyMax application and logs in to his account. Since the league hasn't officially started yet, he is taken to the league home page. 
                    This page shows him the scheduled draft time, and also allows him to look over the league's settings beforehand. Under the draft time are the draft settings. </p> 

                <br><br>

                <p>Frank opens up the draft settings and sees an option: manual-draft or auto-draft. He begrudgingly selects auto-draft, disappointed that he won't be able to be 
                    present for the draft. He now knows that his team will be automatically drafted for him, and he can fulfill his overtime without having to worry about his fantasy team being filled.</p>
