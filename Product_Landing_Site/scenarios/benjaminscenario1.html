                Benjamin is well versed in the game of football but hasn't attended a live game or watch a game 
                on television since he attended college as an undergraduate. Having never played fantasy football but an 
                avid gamer, he wants an app that has a low learning curve and easy to grasp. He plans on using the 
                tutorial feature to get a sense of what it is like to participate in a fantasy football league. Upon using 
                the tutorial feature, a perusal through the FAQ is there to answer any other queries about the general 
                rules and guidelines to fantasy football.<br/><br/>

                He doesn't want his lack of familiarity to fantasy sports to be a hindrance to the potential benefits of
                this software. An app that is too complicated would definitely be a deterrent, he would like to be able to
                select from various skill levels and have some of the more technical details be automated.
