                Each season it seems like Austin is always asked by people who just want him to participate in free leagues. He doesn’t typically join these leagues because there is nothing on the line and he does not want to distract himself from all of his more serious fantasy leagues.  
                <br/><br/>
                Most of the time if Austin is asked to join these leagues, he does not participate. But if the league desperately needs players, he is willing to hop in and participate. In these circumstances Austin typically prioritizes his leagues based on which one he has paid more in entry fees. The leagues that are the more expensive leagues requires more attention. Whereas the free leagues he joins he hardly updates his roster, and some weeks he even forgets to check the waiver wire. 

                <br/><br/>

                In this circumstance Austin uses FantasyMAX automate option to generate his weekly lineups and make draft selections. He can enable this setting so that he doesn’t have to pay much attention to the free leagues he is in, and yet still participate in the fantasy league.
