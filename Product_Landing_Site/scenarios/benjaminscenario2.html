                Benjamin doesn't want to deal with the overhead of starting and creating a league but would gladly 
                accept an invitation to join a league that has been already created and looking to add new members. 
                He logs onto the application using his credentials and check for the invitations he has received. If his 
                list of invitations is empty, he can have the app randomly select a league with an open 
                invitation.<br/><br/>

                He decides that he wants to have a more interactive approach to the league he plays in, so he checks 
                to see what other leagues are actively looking to add players. He selects one and confirms his 
                selection and a message is displayed saying that he has been successfully added to a fantasy league 
                and from then on, he'll get notifications about drafts, deadlines, player trades, score updates and 
                match-ups from the other members of the league.
