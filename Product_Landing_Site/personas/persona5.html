                        Austin, age 27, is an employee at a large manufacturing company. He is from the Louisville 
                        Kentucky area. He has an undergraduate degree at a local university. Austin likes to live life on the edge. 
                        He works hard and plays even harder. In his spare time Austin loves to do motocross and finds himself at 
                        the casino at least once a month.  Austin is self-motivated and is always trying increase his earnings for 
                        himself and his company.</br></br>

                        Austin looks forward to fantasy football season each year. He is too busy to play in free leagues 
                        because of his active lifestyle. He doesnâ€™t really get the point of playing fantasy football for free. Each 
                        fantasy football season he reaches out to friends and family to tries to get a pool of money together for 
                        fantasy football leagues. Last year he paid 500 dollars in entry fees for 4 leagues.
