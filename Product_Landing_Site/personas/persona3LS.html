                    <p>Karen, age 60, grew up on a dairy farm near Salem, IN but she moved to Madison, IN, a small town on the Ohio River between Louisville, KY and Cincinatti, OH, shortly after graduating from college in her early twenties. She is married to a car dealer and between them they have four children and four grandchildren. Karen enjoys an active social life including frequent activities with a small group of close-knit friends. She and her husband enjoy boating, hiking and travel.

                        <br/><br/>Karen has worked as a high school English teacher since earning a masters degree in education at age 23. She has held the same position her entire career and for most of that time she has taught senior English. She takes pride in preparing her students for a successful college experience. Her students know that they will be challenged in her classes but for the most part she is highly regarded. She is currently struggling with deciding if and when to retire.  
                        
                        <br/><br/>Karen has a high level of technical expertise, both in the classroom and in her personal life. She enjoys using the latest digital devices including an Apple watch, iPad and MacBook Pro. She is active on Facebook and loves doing Internet research on a wide range of interests. She has no barriers to the adoption of new technical skills and would not have difficulty learning to use a fantasy football app. 
                        
                        <br/><br/>She initially reported no more than passing interest in college football but she rallied at the prospect of participation as a group competition. She began to imagine various scenarios such as group get-togethers to watch the games with the losers responsible for providing dinner, snacks, beverages, etc. She astutely wanted to know how her team would be created and showed interest in the draft process. Given her limitied knowledge of teams and players, she indicated that it would be helpful for the app to provide a compendium of information to assist novices during the draft, similar to the programs provided at horse-racing tracks.
