                        Frank, age 24, is a Quality Assurance Engineer in Naples, FL. Frank graduated from the
                        University of Cincinnati in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in biomechanical engineering. As an
                        avid sports fan, he was particularly drawn to become passionate towards University of Cincinnati
                        athletics, especially UC Football given their recent trip to the College Football Playoffs. His 
                        fandom has continued post-graduation, and college football is still the sport he is most passionate 
                        about.</br></br>

                        Frank has vast knowledge of and experience with fantasy football. Playing in NFL fantasy 
                        leagues since 2014, he has experienced the highs and lows of competing - from winning his 
                        league to coming in dead last. He knows all the ins and outs of how to manage a fantasy team, as 
                        well as the qualities that make a league great. For Frank, FantasyMax would allow him to 
                        continue his fantasy football career, while switching gears to the college level which he enjoys 
                        more than the NFL.
