                        Benjamin, age 26, is a R&D at a large catalyst corporation in Louisville. Originally from St. Louis, he
                        moved to Louisville after graduating from college to pursue a career. He is married with no children
                        and is currently completing his master's in chemistry.<br /><br />
        
                        His career goal is to advance in his STEM field by making a different in environmental chemistry. Very
                        proficient in the use of software technology, one of his many hobbies includes film making and is quick
                        to pick up on various movie editing software technology. He might use our product to get back into watching college
                        football. He hasn't been keeping up with the sport since he left college, and he feels that Fantasy Max
                        could be his reintroduction into fandom. He wouldn't actively look to start a league but would be
                        more than happy to accept an invitation.
