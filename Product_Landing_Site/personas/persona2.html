                        Kylie, age 25, is a full-time engineer and small business owner for a collegiate clothing company in 
                        Lexington, KY. As a small business owner for collegiate clothing, Kylie has been able to interact with a 
                        variety of students, alumni, and fans of colleges within Division I-III of the NCAA & NAIA. Kylie has been 
                        competing in Fantasy NFL leagues since 2018. As an alumna of the University of Louisville, she has found
                        a recent desire to keep up with college football. The creation of FantasyMax would allow her to be
                        abreast of college football, create some investment in players, as well as compete in more fantasy
                        leagues.
