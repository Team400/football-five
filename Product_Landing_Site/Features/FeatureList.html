                            <u>Description</u><br>
                            As a user of FantasyMax, I want the ability to create a division with a name of my choosing.
                            This division will be exclusively comprised of my group's teams and the app will provide a dashboard 
                            that shows the current performance statistics and ranking of the teams in my division. These statistics 
                            will be updated within the hour following any regular season game in which any of my division's teams 
                            competes. Team names will be chosen by the team managers limited by a system to ensure no duplication of names within the division.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <u>Constraints</u><br>
                            There will be a limit on the maximum number of teams in a division to avoid crowding of the dashboard and to 
                            limit administrative overhead. There will be a system for monitoring division and team names to ensure that they are 
                            legal, unique, and not offensive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <u>Comments</u><br>
                            To avoid problems with division and team names, it may be necessary to require that users choose their names from a pre-approved list rather 
                            than creating their own. This would have the added benefit of eliminating duplicated because when a stock name was chosen, it would be removed 
                            from the list so that it could not be chosen again.

                            Administering premium feeds would add a layer of complexity to the app and would require interfacing 
                            with the providers of those feeds. Thus, it may or may not be feasible to provide this level of service 
                            to the app's users, pending further investigations.

                            As a college football novice, I want FantasyMax to provide a pre-season compendium of information about the games, teams 
                            and players to assist me during the draft. This compendium will be kept current regarding any last-minute developments. After the draft, 
                            the compendium will transition to an ongoing season commentary on the actual NCAA teams and players as well as fantasy divisions and players. 
                            Division-specific content will be submitted by division representatives and will be published pending editorial review.

                            The team roster will have a set of columns for pre-defined statistics, not modifiable by me, but there will also be a set of columns where I can include data of my own choosing for each player.

                            As user of the software, I'd like to create different teams that participate in different fantasy leagues, or I can select the same team across multiple leagues.<br>

                            As someone who is in complex rules leagues, Austin wants the ability to customize league settings. He needs the ability to manage his fantasy league like an actual team owner would.<br>
                            Since Austin is super busy, an automation of drafting players should be included in the application.

                            Because messaging can take away some of the storage & data from the application, there would need to be some threshold on storing messages.
