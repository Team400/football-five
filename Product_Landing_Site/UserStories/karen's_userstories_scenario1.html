                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX, I want a dashboard that I can customize to select my group's teams for display so that I can monitor my team's performance relative to the performance of my group's teams.</li>
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX, I want the dashboard to display results in ranked order, best performing team at the top so that I can easily see which team is in the lead, which is second, etc.</li>
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX, I want to provide a logo for my team and have it displayed adjacent to my team's name on the dashboard. This will engender pride in being the team's manager and add distinctiveness to the team representations.</li>  
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX, instead of providing my own logo, I want to have the option of choosing from a set of stock logos provided by the app, so that I can still take pride in being the team's manager without having the technical expertise or time to create my own logo.</li>
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX, I want a dashboard that displays a daily factoid about college football, either current or historical, at the top of the page to enhance my interest and knowledge.</li>
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX,  I want to be able to add to the dashboard a brief message, just a few words, visible only to my group members, so that I can encourage or smack talk them.</li>
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMAX, I want the option of displaying my dashboard or my team spreadsheet when the app opens, for my convenience.</li>
                        <li>As a user of FantasyMax, I want the app to send me a text or an email when my team moves up or down in rank within my group, to maintain interest and keep me abreast of my team's standings.</li>
