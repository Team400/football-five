            <h3>Who is This Product Good For?</h3>
            <p>This application is designed for avid sports fans who want more fantasy football options than just NFL. It is designed for people who have an interest in developing and maintaining a Fantasy league with friends, co-workers, peers, and family! </p>
    
            <h3>Our Slogan</h3>
            <p>This is <strong>YOUR</strong> Fantasy, To the <strong>MAX</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Our Product Vision</h3>
            <p><strong>For</strong> avid college football fanatics <strong>who</strong> want a competitive experience with friends through the fantasy sports realm. The FantasyMax App is a web-based gaming service <strong>that</strong> allows users the same luxuries of fantasy NFL but on the college level, along with various custom options available. <strong>Unlike</strong> other fantasy sports applications, <strong>our project</strong> allows users to enjoy the fantasy football experience on the college level while being customizable from draft selection to text formatting on each user's screen.</p>

            <h3>Our Product's Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can choose to have their draft picks automated; some users may not want to hand pick all their players but would rather have the app do this for them.</li>
                <li>Users can print their picks; users can peruse their selections to get a feel for their roster.</li>
                <li>Users can select the types of roster selection for their league such as: salary cap leagues, keeper leagues, dynasty leagues, etc... Other fantasy football platforms do not provide this option. Other types of fantasy football apps are tailor made for a particular type of roster selection.</li>
                <li>Users also have the ability to select the format of the league competition such as: head-to-head league, total points league. Once again other apps don't provide this flexibility, some apps offer traditional league format and others keeper/dynasty league format. For example, the apps that provide a betting pool only operate on daily fantasy sport league format.</li>
                <li>Users will be able to select a picture to represent their team, the ability to select logo to represent the team gives the user a sense of individuality as if this is the actual logo for their sports organization.</li>
            </ul>
