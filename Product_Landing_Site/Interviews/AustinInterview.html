                    <p><strong><u>What fantasy application do you currently use? </u></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>He responded with what current fantasy football applications he currently uses, what he currently likes to use. He mentioned that Yahoo Fantasy sports application is currently the one he uses the most.  </li>

                        <p><strong><u>What do you like about Yahoo Sports fantasy application? </u></strong></p>
                        <li>He likes Yahoo fantasy the most. It has simple to use interface that doesn’t take much time to use.</li>
                       
                        <p><strong><u>How many leagues do you play in and who do you pay with? </u></strong></p>
                    <break></break>
                        <li>He typically plays in 3-4 fantasy league per season all of which are for some type of money. He typically plays with co-workers, friends and family.</li>
                    
                        
                        
                        <p><strong><u>What do you not enjoy about the past leagues you've been in? </u></strong></p>
                    <break></break>


                        <li> He doesn’t typically like to be commissioner because the commissioner always has to do the organizing of the league and collect all the league fees from the participants. He's usually commissioner in one league per season if he has to be.</li>

                        <p><strong><u>What do you enjoy about the past leagues you've been in? </u></strong></p>
                        <break></break>
                        <li>He mentioned he really likes the fact that he could make money playing fantasy. Last year he made a thousand dollars on one league he participated in. </li>
                        
                        <li>He mentioned  he like that he was in complex leagues that enabled players to manage their respective teams like an actual owner of a team would. They had things like salary caps where each manager cannot go over the salary cap. Each player is worth more based on their caliber when drafting. </li>

                        <p><strong><u>What would improve the fantasy leagues you were a part of in the past? </u></strong></p>
                        <li>He mentioned it would be nice to have side betting in leagues </li>
