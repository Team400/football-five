# Project Team400

## Part One:

Our product is a fantasy sports app for college football.  We considered several possible names for the app including NoProFootball, NoProGridiron, FantasyMax, CampusMax and PigskinCampus. We eventually settled on ... because it is descriptive, it sparks the imagination, and the word "campus" suggests that the app is specific to football at the college level.

Among the potential users of the product will be college football fans who enjoy following teams and players with greater focus and intensity than the casual observer, and particularly those who want to up their stake by taking on the challenge of creating and managing their own team. In addition, we anticipate that colleges and universities will incorporate the app into their marketing programs to generate interest in their teams and thus increase revenues. Finally, the app will promote competition between users, including financial incentives where gambling is legal. The prospect of gambling will be an added enticement to professional and amateur gamblers alike.

Users of the app become "team managers." College football teams are created in a formal draft at the beginning of each season. Team managers may participate in the draft by selecting, in turn, from the list of remaining players, or a manager may elect to have their team created for them in an auto-draft. Auto-draft means simply that when it is the manager's turn to choose, a player will be selected for them from a ranked "wish-list" provided in advance by the manager. 

Individuals may participate either alone or as a member of a group - the app will promote social engagement by the optional formation of groups where the individual group members compete among themselves or where the group fields one team to represent all.

One or more commissioners will be responsible for administering the league and tallying results which will be published on the app weekly. Commissioners can create an option for team managers to be selected by lottery, similar to drafts for professional fantasy sports. 

For managers who choose to gamble, there will be three ways to provide funds for betting: credit card, digital money transfer, and cryptocurrency. It is also anticipated that there will be "off-app" competitions, with and without betting, between individuals and/or members of a group.
